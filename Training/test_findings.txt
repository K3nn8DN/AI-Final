first the only difference was epsilon .1 - .6 the best performing were .1 in first  .6 in second and .4 in third

the second test was between discount factors .99 and .88 since .95 was already done 
the winner was .1 with .99 the runner up was .4 with .88 then lastly .1 with .88 
since .1 is already known to be good i dropped the last one leaving the top two 

the third test was between learning rate .1 .2 and .3
.1 is the same as the previouse winner so this should thin out the competition in the next test making one less test to do later


2 winners from 3rd vs 

.95s and 2 winners from 2nd
